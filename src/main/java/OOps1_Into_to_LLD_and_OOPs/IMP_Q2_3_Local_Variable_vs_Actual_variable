Q2:
 public static void main(String[] args) {
       Student s1 = new Student();
       s1.age = 10;
       s1.name = "A";

       Student s2 = new Student();
       s2.age = 20;
       s2.name = "B";

       swap(s1, s2);

       s1.display();
   }

   private static void swap(Student s1, Student s2) {
       int tage = s1.age;
       s1.age = s2.age;
       s2.age = tage;

       String tname = s1.name;
       s1.name = s2.name;
       s2.name = tname;
   }

   NOTE: IN this the s1 passed in swap object in a local variable that is pointing
   to actual s1 student object
   So, it can access the the data member by another variable(means local s1 variable)
   So that why the val get swapped

   Q3:
    public static void main(String[] args) {
          Student s1 = new Student();
          s1.age = 10;
          s1.name = "A";

          Student s2 = new Student();
          s2.age = 20;
          s2.name = "B";

          swap(s1, s2);

          s1.display();
      }

      private static void swap(Student s1, Student s2) {
           Student temp = s1;
           s1 = s2;
           s2 = temp;
      }
   }

   But in this question the local value s1 is swapped by local variable s2.
   And it get lost as the swap function ends
   So no actual swapping is done
